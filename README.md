# Keymap Editor Demo: Corne

> [!Caution]
> Don't bother with this repository, it will not work with an actual Corne keyboard.

This repository is no longer relevant. Originally it existed to provide a
quick way to get your own repository up and running with Keymap Editor,
using a popular keyboard.

The biggest hurdle for most people was having a layout definition, which
I've started to auto-generate when possible and in some cases I've started
to compile them in the [keymap-editor-contrib] repo. If you want to see
what the Keymap Editor's layout metadata looks like, check that repo out.

If you're looking for a starter for your ZMK keyboard code, look through
ZMK's documentation [Installing ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup).
